# S9380ZHU1AYA1 V6 source package

This is the minimal source package used to compile the V6 payload that
reached `done=1 root=1` on SM-S9380 ZHU firmware S9380ZHU1AYA1.

The package intentionally does not contain `.o` files. They are generated
under `build/v6/obj` or `objects-rebuilt` during compilation.

## Target configuration

The ADB offset table is:

`target/adb/pa3q-S9380ZHU1AYA1/target.h`

The APP copy starts at:

`target/app/pa3q-S9380ZHU1AYA1/target.h`

Target table SHA-256:

`F0DD37BDDFCF157CE2ACD9E3CEA7D6D5002C3EF15BA0F7094EF32375DBFE8D51`

## Source layout

The verified ADB baseline is under `src/adb/`. A matching working copy is
under `src/app/` for the APP-specific implementation. The Makefile currently
builds the ADB baseline; APP sources can diverge without changing the tested
ADB tree. KernelSnitch headers are kept inside each variant directory.

`helper/su_daemon.c` is the helper used both by `--run-payload` and by the
kernel UMH path. It must be installed at the fixed `ROOT_UMH_PATH`.

## Build on Windows

Open PowerShell in this directory and run:

```powershell
.\build-v6.ps1
```

The script defaults to the NDK r29 clang path used for the successful build.
Pass `-Clang` if the NDK is installed elsewhere.

The outputs are written to `artifact-rebuilt/`.

## Build with Make

On Linux, WSL, or macOS with an Android NDK clang:

```sh
make CLANG=/path/to/clang
```

The Makefile writes only final artifacts under `build/v6/artifact`; object
files are not required for this build.

The expected payload hash is:

`B4A4E0A69B081FEC4840D0E47CDE5C4FAD50D9F93B04908739A5EC64B085EFCA`

The known-good V6 payload hash is:

`B4A4E0A69B081FEC4840D0E47CDE5C4FAD50D9F93B04908739A5EC64B085EFCA`

The helper source is `helper/su_daemon.c`; it is compiled together with the
payload by `build-v6.ps1` or `make`.

## Runtime entry

The successful ADB entry used the helper loader, not direct `LD_PRELOAD`:

```text
PSELECT_ROUTE_ATTEMPTS=1
PSELECT_DELAY_USEC=10000
/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root --run-payload \
/data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499 \
  /data/local/tmp/cve-2026-43499-root \
  /data/local/tmp/zhu-v6.log
```

The success line from the known-good run was:

```text
pipe-physrw-summary ... done=1 root=1 ...
```
